Replication Controllers and ReplicaSets

Controllers are the backbone of Kubernetes, responsible for monitoring and managing Kubernetes objects to ensure the desired state is maintained.

Both Replication Controllers and ReplicaSets serve the same fundamental purposeâ€”ensuring that a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.
However, they are not identical. Replication Controller is an older technology that has been largely replaced by ReplicaSet, which is now the recommended method for managing pod replication in Kubernetes.
